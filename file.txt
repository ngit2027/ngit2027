INTRODUCTION TO ARDUINO
Arduino Uno
The Arduino Uno is an open-source microcontroller board based on the Microchip ATmega328Pmicrocontroller and developed by Arduino.cc.
Along with ATmega328P, it consists other components such as crystal oscillator, serial communication, voltage regulator etc to support the microcontroller, a USB connection, a power barrel jack, an ICSP header and a reset button.
The board is equipped with sets of digital and analog input/output (I/O) pins that may be interfaced to various expansion boards (shields) and other circuits .
The board has 14 digital I/O pins (six capable of PWM output), 6 analog I/O pins, and is programmable with the Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment), via a type B USB cable.
It can be powered by the USB cable or by an external 9-volt battery, though it accepts voltages between 7 and 20 volts.

How to use Arduino Board
 
The 14 digital input/output pins can be used as input or output pins by using pinMode(), digitalRead() and digitalWrite() functions in arduino programming. Each pin operate at 5V and can provide or receive a maximum of 40mA current, and has an internal pull-up resistor of 20-50KOhms which are disconnected by default. Out of these 14 pins, some pins have specific functions as listed below:
• Serial Pins 0 (Rx) and 1 (Tx): Rx and Tx pins are used to receive and transmit TTL serialdata. They are connected with the corresponding ATmega328P USB to TTL serial chip.
• External Interrupt Pins 2 and 3: These pins can be configured to trigger an interrupt on alow value, a rising or falling edge, or a change in value.
• PWM Pins 3, 5, 6, 9 and 11: These pins provide an 8-bit PWM output by usinganalogWrite() function.
• SPI Pins 10 (SS), 11 (MOSI), 12 (MISO) and 13 (SCK): These pins
are used for SPI communication.
 
• In-built LED Pin 13: This pin is connected with an built-in LED, when pin 13 is HIGH – LED is on and when pin 13 is LOW, its off.
 
Along with 14 Digital pins, there are 6 analog input pins, each of which provide 10 bits of resolution, i.e. 1024 different values. They measure from 0 to 5 volts but this limit can be increased by using AREF pin with analog Reference() function.
• Analog pin 4 (SDA) and pin 5 (SCA) also used for TWI communication using Wire library.
Arduino Uno has a couple of other pins as explained below:
 
• AREF: Used to provide reference voltage for analog inputs with analogReference() function.
• Reset Pin: Making this pin LOW, resets the microcontroller.
 
Communication
 
Arduino can be used to communicate with a computer, another Arduino board or other microcontrollers. The ATmega328P microcontroller provides UART TTL (5V) serial communication which can be done using digital pin 0 (Rx) and digital pin 1 (Tx). An ATmega16U2 on the board channels this serial communication over USB and appears as a virtual com port to software on the computer. The ATmega16U2 firmware uses the standard USB COM drivers, and no external driver is needed. However, on Windows, a .inf file is required. The Arduino software includes a serial monitor which allows simple textual data to be sent to and from the Arduino board. There are two RX and TX LEDs on the arduino board which will flash when data is being transmitted via the USB-to-serial chip and USB connection to the computer (not for serial communication on pins 0 and 1). A Software Serial library allows for serial communication on any of the Uno's digital pins. The ATmega328P also supports I2C (TWI) and SPI communication. The Arduino software includes a Wire library to simplify use of the I2C bus.

Raspberry Pi on board Serial Communication standards
 
UART:
UART is multi master communication protocol. This protocol is quite easy to use and veryconvenient for communicating between several boards: Raspberry Pi to Raspberry Pi, or Raspberry Pi to Arduino, etc.
 
 
For using UART you need 3 pins:
 
- GND that will connect to the global GND of your circuit.
- RX for Reception. It will connect this pin to the -​TX pin of the other component.
- TX for Transmission. It will connect this pin to the RX of the other component.
 
If the component you’re communicating with is not already powered, you’ll also have to use a power pin (3.3V or 5V) to power on that component.

87
 
By using a UART to USB converter, you can communicate between your laptop and Raspberry Pi with UART.
 
I2C:
I2C is a 2 WIRE master-slave bus protocol (it can have multiple masters but mostly used with one master and multiple slaves). The most common use of I2C is to read data from sensors and actuate some components.
 
The master is the Raspberry Pi, and the slaves are all connected to the same bus. Each slave has a unique ID, so the Raspberry Pi knows which component it should talk to.
 
 
 
 
 
For using I2C you’ll need 3 pins:
 
1. GND:
2. SCL: clock of the I2C. Connect all the slaves SCL to the SCL bus.
3. SDA: exchanged data. Connect all the slaves SDA to the SDA bus. 4.
Note that the SDA and SCL pins on the Raspberry Pi are alternate functions for GPIO 2 and 3. When you use a library (Python, Cpp, etc) for I2C, those two GPIOs will be configured so they can use their alternate function.
 
.
 
 
 
SPI
Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) is a synchronous serial data protocol used for communicating with one or more peripheral devices.
SPI is yet another hardware communication protocol. It is a master-slave bus protocol. Itrequires
more wires than I2C, but can be configured to run faster.


 
As you can see, you get 2 SPIs by default: SPI0 and SPI1. It means you can use the Raspberry Pias a SPI master on two different SPI buses at the same time.
 
And, as for I2C, SPI uses the alternate functions of GPIOs. For using SPI you’ll need 5 pins:
1. GND: what a surprise! Make sure you connect all GND from all your slave components and the Raspberry Pi together.
2. SCLK: clock of the SPI. Connect all SCLK pins together.
 
3. MOSI: means Master Out Slave In. This is the pin to send data from the master to a slave.
4. MISO: means Master In Slave Out. This is the pin to receive data from a slave to the master.
5. CS: means Chip Select. Pay attention here: you’ll need one CS per slave on your circuit. By default you have two CS pins (CS0 – GPIO 8 and CS1 – GPIO 7). You can configure more CS pins from the other available GPIOs.

Raspberry Pi Python Basics
 
1 .Python RPi.GPIO API Library
• One of the famous library in launching input and output pins is the RPi.GPIO library.You can use this library in python programming.
 
• Use the RPi.GPIO module as the driving force behind our Python GPIO examples. Thisset of Python files and source is included with Raspbian OS --NOOBS,(Linux based )
 
2. How to Setup RPi.GPIO
• ​This library is available on Raspbian operating system by default and you don’t need toinstall it.
 
• In order To us RPi.GPIO in Python script, you need to put this statement at the top ofyour file: import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
 
• That statement "includes" the RPi.GPIO module, and goes a step further by providing alocal name -- GPIO -- which we'll call to reference the module from here on.
 
3. Pin Numbering Declaration
• After including the RPi.GPIO module, the next step is to determine which of the two pin- numbering schemes
 
• 1. GPIO.BOARD : Board numbering scheme. The pin numbers follow the pin numbers on header P1.
 
• 2. GPIO.BCM : Broadcom chip-specific pin numbers. These pin numbers follow the lower-level numbering system defined by the Raspberry Pi's Broadcom-chip brain.
 
• To specify in your code which number-system is being used, use the GPIO.setmode() function.
Example:
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)#will activate the Broadcom-chip specific pin numbers.
 
Note: Both the import and setmode lines of code are required, if you want to use Python.
4. Setting a Pin Mode:
 
• If you've used Arduino, you're probably familiar with declare a "pin mode" before you can use it as either an input or output.
 
• In Raspberry Pi to set a pin mode, use the
 
GPIO.setup(pin number, pinmode) function.
 
• Example: if you want to set pin 18 as an output, write:
 
• GPIO.setup(18, GPIO.OUT)
 
Note: Remember that the pin number will change if you're using the board numbering system (instead of 18, it'd be 12).
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM); Using pins BCM numbers
 
Basic Commands
 
• GPIO.setup(pin, GPIO.IN); Determines the pin as input
 
• GPIO.setup( pin, GPIO.OUT); Determines the pin as an output
 
• GPIO.input(pin): Reading input pin
 
• GPIO.output( pin, state): Writing on the output pin.

Experiment 1: Controlling LED ON/OFF with Arduino/ESP32/Raspberry Pi
 
AIM: To interface & write a python program to Control LED ON/OFF with Arduino/ESP32/ Raspberry Pi.
Components Required:
• Raspberry Pi/Arduino UNO
• LED
• Resistors 470Ω
• Jumper wires
Theory:
LED: 
 
 
• The LED is a special type of diode and they have similar electrical characteristics to a PN junction diode. Hence the LED allows the flow of current in the forward direction and blocks the current in the reverse direction.
• The LED symbol is similar to a diode symbol except for two small arrows that specify the emission of light, thus it is called LED (light-emitting diode). The LED includes two terminals namely anode (+) and the cathode ( -). The LED symbol is shown below.
 
 

 
Working of LED
• When the voltage is not applied to the LED, then there is no flow of electrons and holes so they are stable. Once the voltage is applied then the LED will forward biased, so the electrons in the N-region and holes from P- region will move to the active region. This region is also known as the depletion region. Because the charge carriers like holes include a positive charge whereas electrons have a negative charge so the light can be generated through the recombination of polarity charges
 
Figure: Working of Light Emitting Diode
 
 
2. Resistor:
 
• A resistor is a passive two-terminal electrical component that implements electrical resistance as a circuit element.
• In electronic circuits, resistors are used to reduce current flow, adjust signal levels, to divide voltages, bias active elements, and terminate transmission lines, among other uses.
 
Symbol of Resistor
• Resistor is a 2 terminal passive device. The symbol is given below.
 
 
 
 
Figure: Resistor Symbol
 
Unit of resistance
 
• The SI-unit of resistance is Ohm [Ω]. The higher multiple and sub-multiple values of ohm is kilo ohms [KΩ], mega ohms [MΩ], milli ohm and so on

Theory:
OLED:
The organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display SSD1306 model: a monocolor, 0.96-inch display with 128×64 pixels as shown in the following figure.
 
 
The OLED display doesn’t require backlight, which results in a very nice contrast in dark environments. Additionally, its pixels consume energy only when they are on, so the OLED display consumes less power when compared with other displays.
The model we’re using here has only four pins and communicates with the Arduino using I2C communication protocol. There are models that come with an extra RESET pin. There are also other OLED displays that communicate using SPI communication.
 
Pin wiring
Because the OLED display uses I2C communication protocol, wiring is very simple. You just need to connect to the Arduino Uno I2C pins as shown in the table below.

PIR SENSOR
 
• A passive infrared sensor (PIR sensor) is an electronic sensor that measures infrared (IR) light radiating from objects in its field of view.(range)
• PIR sensors are commonly used in security alarms and automatic lighting applications.
• PIR sensors detect general movement, but do not give information on who or what moved.
PIN DESCRIPTION
• Pin1 corresponds to the drain terminal of the device, which connected to the positive supply 5V DC.
• Pin2 corresponds to the source terminal of the device, which connects to the ground terminal via a 100K or 47K resistor. The Pin2 is the output pin of the sensor.
• Pin3 of the sensor connected to the ground.
 
 
 
PIR WORKING
 
• The PIR sensor itself has two slots in it, each slot is made of a special material
                 that is sensitive to IR. When the sensor is idle, both slots detect the same amount of IR,            
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           the ambient amount radiated from the room or walls or outdoors.
• When a warm body like a human or animal passes by, it first intercepts one half

87
 
of the PIR sensor, which causes a positive differential change between the two halves. When the warm body leaves the sensing area, the reverse happens, whereby the sensor generates a negative differential change. These change pulses are what is detected.

Traffic Light System:
 
Traffic lights are an essential part of today’s road infrastructure. Traffic lights are a set of three lights that signal whether one grouping of Vehicles can go or if they need to stop by combining these lights in series at an intersection a smooth flow of traffic can be ensured. Green signals “GO”, Yellow or Amber signals to “Slow Down and Prepared to Stop” and Red means “Stop”. As a vehicle approaches a traffic light at a typical intersection it has the choice of turning left, right or going straight. These choices have to be addressed by the signal from the traffic light.

            Experiment 8: Measure the distance using Ultra sonic sensor
 
AIM: To interface & write a python program to measure the distance using ultra sonic sensor with Raspberry Pi.
 
Components required:
- RaspberryPi3b+board/ESP32
- 1 HDMI Probe
- Keyboard
- Mouse
- Monitor
- SDCard with NOOBSOS
- Ultra sonic sensor
- Dustbin
 
Theory:
An ultrasonic sensor is an electronic device that measures the distance of a target object by emitting ultrasonic sound waves, and converts the reflected sound into an electrical signal.
 
The HC-SR04 is a type of ultrasonic sensor which uses sonar to find out the distance of the object from the sensor. It provides an outstanding range of non-contact detection with high accuracy & stable readings. It includes two modules like ultrasonic transmitter & receiver. This sensor is used in a variety of applications like measurement of direction and speed, burglar alarms, medical, sonar, humidifiers, wireless charging, non-destructive testing, and ultrasonography.
 
HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor Pin Configuration
This sensor includes four pins and the pin configuration of this sensor is discussed below.
• Pin1 (Vcc): This pin provides a +5V power supply to the sensor.
• Pin2 (Trigger): This is an input pin, used to initialize measurement by transmitting ultrasonic waves by keeping this pin high for 10us.
• Pin3 (Echo): This is an output pin, which goes high for a specific time period and it will be equivalent to the duration of the time for the wave to return back to the sensor.
• Pin4 (Ground): This is a GND pin used to connect to the GND of the system.
 
Features:
 
• The power supply used for this sensor is +5V DC
• Dimension is 45mm x 20mm x 15mm
• Quiescent current used for this sensor is <2mA
• The input pulse width of trigger is10uS
• Operating current is 15mA
• Measuring angle is 30 degrees
• The distance range is 2cm to 800 cm
• Resolution is 0.3 cm
• Effectual Angle is <15°
• Operating frequency range is 40Hz
• Accuracy is 3mm
 
• The HC-SR04 Ultrasonic sensor comes with four pins namely Vcc pin, Trigger pin, Echo pin, & Ground pin. This sensor is used to measure the accurate distance between the target and the sensor. This sensor mostly works on the sound waves.
 
• When the power supply is given to this module, it generates the sound waves to travel throughout the air to hit the necessary object. These waves strike and come back from the object, then collects by the receiver module.
 
• Here both the distance as well as time has taken is directly proportional because the time taken for more distance is high. If the trigger pin is kept high for 10 µs, then the ultrasonic waves will be generated which will travel at the sound speed. So it creates eight cycles of sonic burst that will be gathered within the Echo pin. This ultrasonic sensor is interfaced with Arduino to gauge the necessary distance between sensor & object. The distance can be calculated using the following formula.
 
• S = (V x t)/2
• Where the ‘S’ is the required distance
 
• ‘V’ is the sound’s speed
 
• ‘t’ is the time taken for sound waves to return back after striking the object.
 
• The actual distance can be calculated by dividing its value with 2 as the time will be twice once the waves travel and get back from the sensor.
Applications:
The applications of HC-SR04 sensor include the following,
• This sensor is used to measure speed as well as the direction between two objects
• It is used in wireless charging
• Medical ultrasonography
• This is used to detect objects & avoid obstacles using robots such as biped, path finding, obstacle avoidance, etc.
• Depth measurement
• Humidifiers
• This sensor is used to plot the objects nearby the sensor by revolving it
• Non-destructive testing
• By using this sensor depth of pits, wells can be measured by transmitting the waves through water.
• Embedded system
• Burglar alarms
 
 
Using a Raspberry Pi distance sensor (Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04)
 
For many (outdoor) projects a distance measurement is necessary or advantageous. These can measure the distance up to 4-5 meters.
Wiring
There are four pins on the ultrasound module that are connected to the Raspberry:
 
• VCC to Pin 2(VCC)
• GND to Pin 6(GND)
• TRIG to Pin12(GPIO18)
• Connect the 330Ω resistor to ECHO. On it send you connect it to Pin18 (GPIO24) and through a 470Ω resistor you connect it also to Pin6(GND).

Firebase:
 
In the era of rapid prototyping, we can get bright ideas, but sometimes they are not applicable if they take too much work. Often, the back-end is the limiting factor - many considerations never apply to server-side coding due to lack of knowledge or time.
 
Firebase is a Backend-as-a-Service(BaaS) which started as a YC11 startup. It grew up into a next-generation app-development platform on Google Cloud Platform. Firebase (a NoSQLjSON database) is a real-time database that allows storing a list of objects in the form of a tree. We can synchronize data between different devices.
 

87
 
Google Firebase is Google-backed application development software which allows developers to develop Android, IOS, and Web apps. For reporting and fixing app crashes, tracking analytics, creating marketing and product experiments, firebase provides several tools.
 
Firebase has three main services, i.e., a real-time database, user authentication, and hosting. We can use these services with the help of the Firebase iOS SDK to create apps without writing any server code.
 

87
 
Why use Firebase:
o Firebase manages real-time data in the database. So, it easily and quickly exchanges the data to and from the database. Hence, for developing mobile apps such as live streaming, chat messaging, etc., we can use Firebase.
o Firebase allows syncing real-time data across all devices - iOS, Android, and Web –without refreshing the screen.
o Firebase provides integration to Google Advertising, AdMob, Data Studio, BigQueryDoubleClick, Play Store, and Slack to develop our apps with efficient and accurate management and maintenance.
o Everything from databases, analytics to crash reports are included in Firebase. So, the app development team can stay focused on improving the user experience.
o Firebase applications can be deployed over a secured connection to the firebase server.
o Firebase offers a simple control dashboard.
o It offers a number of useful services to choose from.
 
Pros and Cons of Firebase:
 
Firebase has a lot of pros or advantages. Apart from the advantages, it has disadvantages too. Let's take a look at the dvantagesand disadvantages:
 
Pros:
o Firebase is a real-time database.
o It has massive storage size potential.
o Firebase is serverless.
o It is highly secure.
o It is the most advanced hosted BaaS solution.
o It has minimal setup.
o It provides three-way data binding via angular fire.
o It provides simple serialization of app state.
o We can easily access data, files, auth and more.

87
 
o There is no server infrastructure required to power apps with data.
o It has JSON storage, which means no barrier between data and objects.
 
 
Cons:
o Firebase is not widely used, or battle-tested for enterprises.
o It has very limited querying and indexing.
o It provides no aggregation.
o It has no map-reduce functionality.
o It cannot query or list users or stored files.
 
 
 
Procedure to Create Firebase Account:
Step1
Login to your Firebase account (https://firebase.google.com/), then go to the Firebase consoleapplication.
 
 
 
 
 
Step2:
Create a new project and fill in the necessary details.
 
 
Step3
 
• Next, goto select Develop and then click on Database in your project.
• After that, the Database appears and select the "Real-time Database GetStarted" button.
 

87
 
Step4
 
Next, gotorules>>changerules. Just replace that with the following code.
 
Default Rules
1.// require authentication
 
3.​"rules":{
5.
".write":"auth!=null"
7.   }
6.​}
".read":"auth!=null",
4.
2.{
 
Change to these rules
 
 
 
This is for the first test. Anyone can read and write your database without authentication.
1.//Not require authentication
 
3.​"rules":{
5.
".write":true
7.   }
6.​}
".read":true,
4.

Sockets:
Sockets are the endpoints of a bidirectional communications channel. Sockets may communicate within a process, between processes on the same machine, or between processes on different continents. Sockets may be implemented over a number of different channel types: Unixdomain sockets, TCP, UDP, and so on.
 
TCP Socket Flow:



87
 


 
 
Socket Programming:
 
• Creates a two-way communication between two nodes in a network
• The nodes are termed as Server and Client
 
Creating a socket:
 
s = socket.socket (SocketFamily, SocketType, Protocol=0)
 
• SocketFamily can be AF_UNIX or AF_INET
• SocketType can be SOCK_STREAM or SOCK_DGRAM
• Protocol is set default to 0

Experiment 12: To upload/update Temperature and Humidity data from ThingSpeak cloud based IOT dash board with Raspberry Pi
 
AIM: To Interface & write a python program to upload/update temperature and humidity data from Thingspeak cloud based IOT dashboard.
 
 
Components required:
- RaspberryPi3b+board
- 1 HDMI Probe
- Keyboard
- Mouse
- Monitor
- SD Card with NOOBSOS
- DHT22
DHT22:
Temperature: A measure of the warmth or coldness of an object or substance with reference to some standard value.
Humidity: A quantity representing the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere.
DHT22: Digital Humidity Temperature sensor
• ​The DHT-22 (also named as AM2302) is a digital-output relative humidity and temperature sensor. It uses a capacitive humidity sensor and a thermistor to measure the surrounding air, and spits out a digital signal on the data pin.
Features
 
• The range of operating voltage() is 3V to 5V power.
• It measures temperature in a range of -40°C to +125°C with an accuracy of ±0.5 degrees.
• The measuring range of humidity is from 0 to 100% with an accuracy of 2-5%.
• The maximum operating current for DHT22 sensor is 2.5mA.
• The sampling rate for DHT22 sensor is 0.5 Hz. It takes measurement once every 2 seconds.

87
 
Pin Description:
 
The DHT22 sensor is very simple and easy to use. It has only four pins.
1. Vcc is the power pin. Apply voltage in a rangeof 3.5V to 5.0V at this pin.
2. DataOut is the digital output pin. It sends out the value of measured temperature and humidity in the form of serial data.
3. N/C is a not connect pin.
4. GND :Connect the GND pin to main ground.
